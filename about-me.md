I am a global health professional, environmental scientist, and food security expert with proven track record and 10 years of experience. I am a specialist in interdisciplinary research, nutrition, agriculture, international development, health education, teaching, project design and management, grant writing, fieldwork, and cross-cultural collaboration.  During my PhD, I focused on edible insects as a sustainable source of low-cost, environmentally friendly protein source.  Through my career, I have developed:
- Passion for sustainably improving health and wellbeing among low-resource communities by optimizing co-benefits across the agriculture – environment – human health nexus 
- Expertise in holistic global health, food security, food sovereignty, climate-smart and nutrition sensitive agriculture, maternal health, gender, and edible insect agriculture
- Strong research capabilities including participatory approaches to applied field research, health impact assessment, clinical trials, bench science, survey development and enumeration, quantitative and qualitative statistical methods, and policy assessment 
- Effective communicator and team leader with advanced technical and scientific writing skills
- Field experience: Kenya, Rwanda, Zambia, South Africa, Ethiopia, India, Palestine, and Peru
