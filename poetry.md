*It took bravery to click on my poetry tab.  But you did it, you're here.  Poetry is the way I understand the world.  It is the perfect complement to my life as a scientist and gives breath to what truly has meaning.  I write modern poetry in a variety of forms and covering topics from insects to the anthropocene to feminism.  I'd love to share more with you if ever you are interested.  For now, I'll let you enjoy this long-form poem from a few years ago.*
