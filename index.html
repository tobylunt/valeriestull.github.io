<p>Valerie Stull is an environmental social scientist and global
health professional who integrates multiple frameworks and disciplines
to elucidate the linkages between agriculture, the environment, and
human health.  Her interdisciplinary work explores ways to ameliorate
current constraints on food security and food sovereignty by
evaluating the social, environmental, and health implications of
innovative agricultural initiatives and development efforts.
Currently, Valerie is investigating farmed edible insects as a
  sustainable protein source in Zambia and the United States. </p>

<p>As a former international development professional and Fulbright
researcher, Valerie is passionate about finding ways to optimize the
use of edible insects for human nutrition, smart economic development,
and as a means to improve planetary health.  She is the Co-Founder of
MIGHTi (the Mission to Improve Global Health Through Insects), a
collaborative research project that is currently investigating social
perceptions of edible insects in contexts where entomophagy is
practiced, the impact of edible cricket consumption on the human gut
microbiome, how supplementing protein-deficient mice with cricket
powder affects metabolic and immune function biomarkers, as well as
the nutritional value of insects reared using agricultural byproducts.
Outside of academia, Valerie is a poet, outdoor enthusiast, and social
justice advocate.  She is currently seeking employment in the global
health sector. </p>
