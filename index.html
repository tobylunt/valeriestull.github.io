<p>Welcome to my website! If youâ€™d like to get in touch please feel
  free to <a href="mailto:vstull@wisc.edu">email me</a>.  You can also follow
  me on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/_vstull_">@_vstull_</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/MIGHTinsects"> @MIGHTinsects</a>.</p>

<p>I am an environmental scientist and global health professional who integrates multiple frameworks and disciplines to elucidate the linkages between agriculture, the environment, and human health.  I am passionate about social justice and improving wellbeing for all.  </p>

<p>All of my interdisciplinary work explores ways to ameliorate current constraints on food security and food sovereignty by evaluating the social, environmental, and health implications of innovative development efforts and agricultural initiatives.</p>

<p>During my PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I investigated farmed edible insects as a sustainable protein source in Zambia and the United States.  As a former international development professional and Fulbright scholar, I have analyzed efficient and socially acceptable ways to optimize the use of edible insects for human nutrition, smart economic development, and as a means to improve planetary health.  </p>
