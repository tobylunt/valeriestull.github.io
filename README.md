# Valerie Stull's webpage

Built using Jekyll, hosted on Github pages. Developed from the excellent [Kiko](http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko), which is a theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It's designed and developed by [@gfjaru](https://twitter.com/gfjaru) - thank you!
